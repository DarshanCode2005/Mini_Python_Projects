Guess the Number Game

This is a simple, console-based Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected number within a limited number of attempts.

ðŸ“œ Description

The program randomly selects an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The player is given 10 attempts to guess this number. After each guess, the program provides feedback, telling the player if their guess was "Too high!" or "Too low!".

If the player guesses the correct number within 10 attempts, they win. If they run out of attempts, the game reveals the secret number.

ðŸš€ How to Run

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

Clone or download this repository (or just save the guess_the_number.py file).

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

Run the following command:

python guess_the_number.py


(Note: You may need to use python3 instead of python on some systems).

ðŸŽ® How to Play

Run the game as described above.

The console will prompt you to "Enter your guess:".

Type a number between 1 and 100 and press Enter.

The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.

Keep guessing until you find the number or run out of attempts!
